Instructions for Running Automated Testing

1. Make sure you're in the ProductionNumber4 Repository which you've cloned, you have built the database, and you are connected to it. The build files are in our sql directory, and the database's name is Planit.

2. Install selenium

	sudo pip install selenium

	sudo pip install requests

3. Run pythontester file

	python ProductionNumber4_automated_testing.py

The test will run two tests: the first test makes sure that when you pull the website the Title is Planit. 
The second test attempts to log in as user mema0341 with password spring2017. It first looks for the login button, clicks it, then enters the parameters and clicks the login button again. After it logs in, it checks to see if the navbar has changed to include the settings and logout buttons.

4. Testing Complete
