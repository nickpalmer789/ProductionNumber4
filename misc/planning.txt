1. Have a page                                              # did this so hard
2. Have DB of users/login with MySQL                        # need to handle encryption with bcrypt in php
3. Profile page (show calendar)                             # turned into dashboard, absorbed goals
4. My Calendar page (add/remove multiple ways)              # working
5. My Goals (Manage goals/pomodoro/todo list)               # the dashboard basically
6. Friends page (Search/view my friends)                    # could be easy, similar to manage groups page
7. Notification panel (See notifications/friend requests)   # no idea
8. Settings panel (password change/my profile)              # Working, may need to move elements
9. Group View (See availability of a whole group)           # tasks are working

Extra:
- Timezones
- DST
- Messaging/chat
- Integrate with Trendzy (find events nearby to add to calendar
- Integrate with SkiU (find people to Ski with dirver/passenger type setup)
- be the best social network (what makes a good one? news, communication about said news, events that all can see, a map that shows them and how people can connect. What makes facebook over bearing? What makes google+ fail? What if both could be solved?)


Todo:
Database - 
	tasks need color selection maybe 

group_calendar - 
    looks incredible
	are privacy settings checked?
    

logout - 
	logout works enough
	this page https://www.sitepoint.com/users-php-sessions-mysql/ is useful

dashboard - 
	looks good for now, can add/delete tasks

login.php - 
	working
	
calendar.php -
	working
    needs tasks to show on it (JS code below to play with)
	
Testing -
	milestone 5 complete
