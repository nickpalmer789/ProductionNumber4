Todo:
Database - 
	calendar needs a recurring option (weekly/monthly/daily etc)
	

group_calendar - 
	load_groups.php needs more coverage to set the title and dropdowns
	this will need to show everyones calendar based on users privacy settings
	how are groups joined? invited for?
	get rid of group tasks section and have that be the invite area?

logout - 
	handle sessions better? logout is not being checked correctly but definitely logs a user out
	this page https://www.sitepoint.com/users-php-sessions-mysql/ is useful

dashboard - 
	looks good for now, can add/delete tasks

login.php - 
	working for now
	
calendar.php -
	need to figure out how to add actual events to the calendar
	
	
Testing -
	How do you unit test a webpage?
	Come up with user scenarios?
