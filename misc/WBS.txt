1. Have a page

6. Friends page (Search/view my friends)

9. Group View (See availability of a whole group)

Extra:

- Messaging/chat



Todo:
Database - 
	make sure tasks has a done check box
	calendar needs a recurring option (weekly/monthly/daily etc)
	

group_calendar - 
	expand the if statement to allow for more db calls in one php block to build the data instead of trying to load the load_groups.php file
	this will need to show everyones calendar based on users privacy settings
	how are groups joined? invited for?


logout - 
	handle sessions better? logout is not being checked correctly but definitely logs a user out
	this page https://www.sitepoint.com/users-php-sessions-mysql/ is useful

dashboard - 
	needs pomodoro timer, maybe tasks?

login.php - 
	make it come back for failures
