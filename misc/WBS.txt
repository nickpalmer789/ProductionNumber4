Todo:
Database - 
	calendar needs a recurring option (weekly/monthly/daily etc)
    https://github.com/tplaner/When
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5183630/calendar-recurring-repeating-events-best-storage-method
    
	tasks need eventColor 

group_calendar - rename to group_tasks (there is no calendar, it pulls from main calendar)
	load_groups.php needs more coverage to set the title and dropdowns
    (SL_GroupCalendar branch has ideas)
	this will need to show everyones calendar based on users privacy settings
    
	how are groups joined? invited for?    
    

logout - 
	logout works enough
	this page https://www.sitepoint.com/users-php-sessions-mysql/ is useful

dashboard - 
	looks good for now, can add/delete tasks

login.php - 
	needs to popup error not go nowhere
	
calendar.php -
	(MM_Calendar_and_Button_attempt) 
    need to figure out how to add actual events to the calendar and the database
    make calendar work with a schedule (database issue)
	make calendar entries show from groups? make them different color, schedule can be default blue
	
Testing -
	How do you unit test a webpage?
	Come up with user scenarios?
    Nick said he would write all of these up for milestone 5
