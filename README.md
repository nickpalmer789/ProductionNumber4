# Description

# Vision Statement
We hope to develop an integrated platform on which one can set up their schedule, manage tasks, see their friends' schedules, and plan and collaborate with one another. 
# Motivation
We found it very difficult to schedule meetings because we are all very busy and have few overlapping free times, so we wanted to automate that process for other groups, as well as create something that integrated todo lists with one's class schedule.
# Risks
-Lack of experience
-Idea may be too ambitious to accomplish within time constraints. May need to be scaled back.(PENDING VISION STATEMENT) 

# Risk Mitigation Plan
-We have enough resources to mitigate the risk of lack of experience. If we don't get enough help from our professors/TA, then we can do research online for projects that are similar ours and see if we can find answers there.
-Modular project - it will be easy to scale the project back if need be. We have distinguished between the features needed for the project to succeed vs. the extra features to be added if we have extra time.
-If we misjudge the time it takes us to work on each feature. Right now the Group View feature seems to be the most difficult to implement. It may take us much more time than we originally thought, or some other feature that we thought would take a short amount of time to implement may take us much longer than anticipated.

# Version Control
Our team will be using git. We will also be using Github to store our remote repository for collaboration. 

# Development Method
We will be using the SCRUM methodology to manage our project and it's goals. 

# Collaboration Tool
We will be using Slack to collaborate together as a messaging board. We will also be using Trello as a collaboration tool that will allow us to keep track of our user story points. 

# Proposed Architecture
php
Bootstrap
MySQL
