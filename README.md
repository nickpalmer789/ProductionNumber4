# Description
The goal for this project is to create an integrated platform to allows users to manage their schedules, time, and group schedules. By making a simple calendar and time management application that is geared towards students, the platform will allow students to better understand time as a resource and form better habits for accomplishing their goals in school and in life. To accomplish this there are three main aspects to the application: My Calendar/My Notifications, My Goals, and the Group View.  
	The My Calendar/My Notifications area of the application allows users to set up their own calendars and set their goals. The calendar view will allow users to easily add classes that they are in from their university, autopopulating their schedules as well as allowing them to see other people that are in their class (so as to facilitate study groups). The calendar view will also allow users to fill their schedules as they create plans, making it easy for the friends that each user has chosen to see when they are busy. The My Notifications section allows users to see notifications and friend requests.   
	My Goals will allow you to create and manage your goals. This will encapsulate the functionality of the to-do list as well as allowing you to manage more long-term goals such as passing classes, getting internships and jobs, or any other goal that a student could have. This will allow students, along with features such as the pomodoro timer, to manage their assignments and goals for the future.  
	The Group View will allow students to overlay their calendars on the same view, making it readily apparent when the entire group can meet up for a face-to-face meeting. The Group View will also have other group interactions such as contact information for each member in your group, or being able to see individual group member's calendars.  
	These basic features of our application will ultimately result in a platform which will allow users to better manage their time as a resource while developing good study habits.  
# Vision Statement
We hope to develop an integrated platform on which one can set up their schedule, manage tasks, see their friends' schedules, and plan and collaborate with one another. 
# Motivation
We found it very difficult to schedule meetings because we are all very busy and have few overlapping free times, so we wanted to automate that process for other groups, as well as create something that integrated todo lists with one's class schedule.
# Risks
-Lack of experience
-Idea may be too ambitious to accomplish within time constraints. May need to be scaled back.
-Spending too much time on a certain task that we believed would be the most difficult. Not paying enough attention to other tasks that we thought would take less time to complete, and then they end up taking longer than anticipated.
-If we misjudge the time it takes us to work on each feature. Right now the Group View feature seems to be the most difficult to implement. It may take us much more time than we originally thought, or some other feature that we thought would take a short amount of time to implement may take us much longer than anticipated.

# Risk Mitigation Plain
-Resources: We have enough resources to mitigate the risk of lack of experience. If we don't get enough help from our professors/TA, then we can do our own research and utilize the experience from other members in our group
-Modular project: it will be easy to scale the project back if need be. We have distinguished between the features needed for the project to succeed vs. the extra features to be added if we have extra time.
-Good time management: Make sure we divide tasks so that not everyone is spending time on any singular item that needs to be completed. That way if we do end up with a task that is more challenging than we anticipated, we know that it is and can work on it.

# Version Control
Our team will be using git. We will also be using Github to store our remote repository for collaboration. 

# Development Method
We will be using the SCRUM methodology to manage our project and it's goals.  
Going with the SCRUM methodology we will break down our workload into epics and user stories, and then we will utilize points poker to assign user story points to these tasks. This will allow our team to track exactly how much work is being done and at what pace.  
Our team will also be meeting weekly for a standup meeting where we will relate what we worked on that week, what we will be working on the next week, and any impedements that we have encountered. This will allow us to stay up to date on the whole team without spending too much time in the weeds each weekly meeting. Our user story points will be tracked both in a google docs spreadsheet (for some statistics and analysis), and in a Trello board where we can move cards around.    

# Collaboration Tool
We will be using Slack to collaborate together as a messaging board. We will also be using Trello as a collaboration tool that will allow us to keep track of our user story points. Our team will also utilize tools such as Google docs when appropriate to keep track of historical story point data, and other copy. 

# Proposed Architecture
php: This will be useful for working with SQL to load data from the database onto the frontend of the application.  
Bootstrap: Our team chose to use Bootstrap, as it is easy to pick up while still being a very powerful frontend framework.  
JavaScript: Our team will be utilizing JavaScript to enable interactive features on the frontend of the application.  
Apache: We will be using apache as our web server for this project, as it is easy to set up and use. 
MySQL: Our team chose to use MySQL as it is free, and relatively easy to set up and work with.
